## Getting Started

### Installation

To install natively, use:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codelion/openevolve.git
cd openevolve
pip install -e .
```

### Quick Start

#### Setting up LLM Access

OpenEvolve uses the OpenAI SDK, which means it works with any LLM provider that supports an OpenAI-compatible API:

1. **Set the API Key**: Export the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

2. **Using Alternative LLM Providers**: 
   - For providers other than OpenAI (e.g., Anthropic, Cohere, local models), update the `api_base` in your config.yaml:
   ```yaml
   llm:
     api_base: "https://your-provider-endpoint.com/v1"
   ```
   
3. **Maximum Flexibility with optillm**: 
   - For advanced routing, rate limiting, or using multiple providers, we recommend [optillm](https://github.com/codelion/optillm)
   - optillm acts as a proxy that can route requests to different LLMs based on your rules
   - Simply point `api_base` to your optillm instance:
   ```yaml
   llm:
     api_base: "http://localhost:8000/v1"
   ```

This setup ensures OpenEvolve can work with any LLM provider - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere, local models via Ollama/vLLM, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

```python
import os
from openevolve import OpenEvolve

# Ensure API key is set
if not os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"):
    raise ValueError("Please set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable")

# Initialize the system
evolve = OpenEvolve(
    initial_program_path="path/to/initial_program.py",
    evaluation_file="path/to/evaluator.py",
    config_path="path/to/config.yaml"
)

# Run the evolution
best_program = await evolve.run(iterations=1000)
print(f"Best program metrics:")
for name, value in best_program.metrics.items():
    print(f"  {name}: {value:.4f}")
```

### Command-Line Usage

OpenEvolve can also be run from the command line:

```bash
python openevolve-run.py path/to/initial_program.py path/to/evaluator.py --config path/to/config.yaml --iterations 1000
```

### Resuming from Checkpoints

OpenEvolve automatically saves checkpoints at intervals specified by the `checkpoint_interval` config parameter (default is 10 iterations). You can resume an evolution run from a saved checkpoint:

```bash
python openevolve-run.py path/to/initial_program.py path/to/evaluator.py \
  --config path/to/config.yaml \
  --checkpoint path/to/checkpoint_directory \
  --iterations 50
```

When resuming from a checkpoint:
- The system loads all previously evolved programs and their metrics
- Checkpoint numbering continues from where it left off (e.g., if loaded from checkpoint_50, the next checkpoint will be checkpoint_60)
- All evolution state is preserved (best programs, feature maps, archives, etc.)
- Each checkpoint directory contains a copy of the best program at that point in time

Example workflow with checkpoints:

```bash
# Run for 50 iterations (creates checkpoints at iterations 10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
python openevolve-run.py examples/function_minimization/initial_program.py \
  examples/function_minimization/evaluator.py \
  --iterations 50

# Resume from checkpoint 50 for another 50 iterations (creates checkpoints at 60, 70, 80, 90, 100)
python openevolve-run.py examples/function_minimization/initial_program.py \
  examples/function_minimization/evaluator.py \
  --checkpoint examples/function_minimization/openevolve_output/checkpoints/checkpoint_50 \
  --iterations 50
```

### Comparing Results Across Checkpoints

Each checkpoint directory contains the best program found up to that point, making it easy to compare solutions over time:

```
checkpoints/
  checkpoint_10/
    best_program.py         # Best program at iteration 10
    best_program_info.json  # Metrics and details
    programs/               # All programs evaluated so far
    metadata.json           # Database state
  checkpoint_20/
    best_program.py         # Best program at iteration 20
    ...
```

You can compare the evolution of solutions by examining the best programs at different checkpoints:

```bash
# Compare best programs at different checkpoints
diff -u checkpoints/checkpoint_10/best_program.py checkpoints/checkpoint_20/best_program.py

# Compare metrics
cat checkpoints/checkpoint_*/best_program_info.json | grep -A 10 metrics
```

### Visualizing the evolution tree

The script in `scripts/visualize.py` allows you to visualize the evolution tree and display it in your webbrowser. The script watches live for the newest checkpoint directory in the examples/ folder structure and updates the graph. Alternatively, you can also provide a specific checkpoint folder with the `--path` parameter.

```bash
# Install requirements
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt

# Start the visualization web server and have it watch the examples/ folder
python scripts/visualizer.py

# Start the visualization web server with a specific checkpoint
python scripts/visualizer.py --path examples/function_minimization/openevolve_output/checkpoints/checkpoint_100/
```

In the visualization UI, you can
- see the branching of your program evolution in a network visualization, with node radius chosen by the program fitness (= the currently selected metric),
- see the parent-child relationship of nodes and click through them in the sidebar (use the yellow locator icon in the sidebar to center the node in the graph),
- select the metric of interest (with the available metric choices depending on your data set),
- highlight nodes, for example the top score (for the chosen metric) or the MAP-elites members,
- click nodes to see their code and prompts (if available from the checkpoint data) in a sidebar,
- in the "Performance" tab, see their selected metric score vs generation in a graph

You can also install and execute via Docker:
```bash
docker build -t openevolve .
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app --network="host" openevolve examples/function_minimization/initial_program.py examples/function_minimization/evaluator.py --config examples/function_minimization/config.yaml --iterations 1000

```

Sample configuration files are available in the `configs/` directory:
- `default_config.yaml`: Comprehensive configuration with all available options
- `island_config_example.yaml`: Advanced island-based evolution setup

### Template Customization

OpenEvolve supports advanced prompt template customization to increase diversity in code evolution:

#### Custom Templates with `template_dir`

You can override the default prompt templates by providing custom ones:

```yaml
prompt:
  template_dir: "path/to/your/templates"
```

Create `.txt` files in your template directory with these names:
- `diff_user.txt` - Template for diff-based evolution
- `full_rewrite_user.txt` - Template for full code rewrites  
- `evolution_history.txt` - Format for presenting evolution history
- `top_program.txt` - Format for top-performing programs
- `previous_attempt.txt` - Format for previous attempts

See these directories for complete examples of custom templates:
- `examples/lm_eval/prompts/` - Custom templates for evaluation tasks
- `examples/llm_prompt_optimization/templates/` - Templates for evolving prompts instead of code

#### Template Variations with Stochasticity

To add randomness to your prompts and prevent getting stuck in local optima:

1. **Enable stochasticity** in your config:
```yaml
prompt:
  use_template_stochasticity: true
  template_variations:
    greeting:
      - "Let's improve this code."
      - "Time to enhance this program."
      - "Here's how we can optimize:"
    analysis_intro:
      - "Current metrics show"
      - "Performance analysis indicates"
      - "The evaluation reveals"
```

2. **Use variation placeholders** in your custom templates:
```
# custom_template.txt
{greeting}
{analysis_intro} the following results:
{metrics}
```

The system will randomly select one variation for each placeholder during prompt generation, creating diverse prompts that can lead to more creative code evolutions.

**Note**: The default templates don't include variation placeholders, so you'll need to create custom templates to use this feature effectively.

### Feature Dimensions in MAP-Elites

Feature dimensions control how programs are organized in the MAP-Elites quality-diversity grid:

**Default Features**: If `feature_dimensions` is NOT specified in your config, OpenEvolve uses `["complexity", "diversity"]` as defaults.

**Built-in Features** (always computed internally by OpenEvolve):
- **complexity**: Code length (recommended default)
- **diversity**: Code structure diversity compared to other programs (recommended default)

Only `complexity` and `diversity` are used as defaults because they work well across all program types.

**Custom Features**: You can mix built-in features with metrics from your evaluator:
```yaml
database:
  feature_dimensions: ["complexity", "performance", "correctness"]  # Mix of built-in and custom
  # Per-dimension bin configuration (optional)
  feature_bins: 
    complexity: 10        # 10 bins for complexity
    performance: 20       # 20 bins for performance (from YOUR evaluator)
    correctness: 15       # 15 bins for correctness (from YOUR evaluator)
```

**Important**: OpenEvolve will raise an error if a specified feature is not found in the evaluator's metrics. This ensures your configuration is correct. The error message will show available metrics to help you fix the configuration.

See the [Configuration Guide](configs/default_config.yaml) for a full list of options.

### Default Metric for Program Selection

When comparing and selecting programs, OpenEvolve uses the following priority:
1. **combined_score**: If your evaluator returns a `combined_score` metric, it will be used as the primary fitness measure
2. **Average of all metrics**: If no `combined_score` is provided, OpenEvolve calculates the average of all numeric metrics returned by your evaluator

This ensures programs can always be compared even without explicit fitness definitions. For best results, consider having your evaluator return a `combined_score` that represents overall program fitness.

## Artifacts Channel

OpenEvolve includes an **artifacts side-channel** that allows evaluators to capture build errors, profiling results, etc. to provide better feedback to the LLM in subsequent generations. This feature enhances the evolution process by giving the LLM context about what went wrong and how to fix it.

The artifacts channel operates alongside the traditional fitness metrics.

### Example: Compilation Failure Feedback

```python
from openevolve.evaluation_result import EvaluationResult

return EvaluationResult(
    metrics={"compile_ok": 0.0, "score": 0.0},
    artifacts={
        "stderr": "SyntaxError: invalid syntax (line 15)",
        "traceback": "...",
        "failure_stage": "compilation"
    }
)
```

The next generation prompt will include:
```markdown
## Last Execution Output
### Stderr
SyntaxError: invalid syntax (line 15)

### Traceback
...
```

## Example: LLM Feedback

An example for an LLM artifact side channel is part of the default evaluation template, which ends with
```markdown
Return your evaluation as a JSON object with the following format:
{{
    "readability": [score],
    "maintainability": [score],
    "efficiency": [score],
    "reasoning": "[brief explanation of scores]"
}}
```
The non-float values, in this case the "reasoning" key of the json response that the evaluator LLM generates, will be available within the next generation prompt.

### Configuration

Artifacts can be controlled via configuration and environment variables:

```yaml
# config.yaml
evaluator:
  enable_artifacts: true

prompt:
  include_artifacts: true
  max_artifact_bytes: 4096  # 4KB limit in prompts
  artifact_security_filter: true
```

```bash
# Environment variable to disable artifacts
export ENABLE_ARTIFACTS=false
```

### Benefits

- **Faster convergence** - LLMs can see what went wrong and fix it directly
- **Better error handling** - Compilation and runtime failures become learning opportunities
- **Rich debugging context** - Full stack traces and error messages guide improvements
- **Zero overhead** - When disabled, no performance impact on evaluation
