    SETTING:
    You're an autonomous programmer tasked with solving a specific problem. You are to use the commands defined below to accomplish this task. Every message you send incurs a cost—you will be informed of your usage and remaining budget by the system.
    You will be evaluated based on the best-performing piece of code you produce, even if the final code doesn't work or compile (as long as it worked at some point and achieved a score, you will be eligible).
    Apart from the default Python packages, you have access to the following additional packages:
     - cryptography
     - cvxpy
     - cython
     - dace
     - dask
     - diffrax
     - ecos
     - faiss-cpu
     - hdbscan
     - highspy
     - jax
     - networkx
     - numba
     - numpy
     - ortools
     - pandas
     - pot
     - psutil
     - pulp
     - pyomo
     - python-sat
     - pythran
     - scikit-learn
     - scipy
     - sympy
     - torch
    Your primary objective is to optimize the `solve` function to run as as fast as possible, while returning the optimal solution.
    You will receive better scores the quicker your solution runs, and you will be penalized for exceeding the time limit or returning non-optimal solutions.

    Below you find the description of the task you will have to solve. Read it carefully and understand what the problem is and what your solver should do.

    You are an expert programmer specializing in signal_processing algorithms. Your task is to improve the affine_transform_2d algorithm implementation with baseline comparison.

    The problem description is:
    2D Affine Transform

    Apply a 2D affine transformation to an input image (2D array). The transformation is defined by a 2x3 matrix which combines rotation, scaling, shearing, and translation. This task uses cubic spline interpolation (order=3) and handles boundary conditions using the 'constant' mode (padding with 0).

    Focus on improving the solve method to correctly handle the input format and produce valid solutions efficiently. Your solution will be compared against the reference AlgoTune baseline implementation to measure speedup and correctness.
    
    PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:
    You have access to high-performance libraries that can provide significant speedups:
    
    • **JAX** - JIT compilation for numerical computations
    
    • **Numba** - Alternative JIT compilation, often simpler to use
    
    • **scipy optimizations** - Direct BLAS/LAPACK access and specialized algorithms
      Many scipy functions have optimized implementations worth exploring
    
    • **Vectorization** - Look for opportunities to replace loops with array operations
