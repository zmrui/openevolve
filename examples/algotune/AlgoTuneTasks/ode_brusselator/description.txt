Brusselator Reaction Model Solver Task:

This task involves solving the Brusselator model, a theoretical autocatalytic chemical reaction system that exhibits oscillatory behavior. The model consists of a system of two coupled nonlinear differential equations:

$$\frac{dX}{dt} = A + X^2Y - (B+1)X$$
$$\frac{dY}{dt} = BX - X^2Y$$

Where:
- X and Y are the concentrations of chemical species
- A and B are control parameters that determine the system's behavior
- The system shows limit cycle oscillations when B > 1 + A²
- The steady state (X = A, Y = B/A) becomes unstable in the oscillatory regime

The Brusselator is notable for its ability to demonstrate spontaneous pattern formation and its relevance to various oscillatory chemical reactions found in nature.

Input:
A dictionary with the following keys:
- `t0`: Initial time (float)
- `t1`: Final time (float, scales with n)
- `y0`: Initial conditions [X₀, Y₀] (list of 2 floats)
- `params`: Dictionary containing:
  - `A`: Control parameter (float)
  - `B`: Control parameter (float)

Example input:
```
{
  "t0": 0.0,
  "t1": 200.0,
  "y0": [1.1, 3.2],  # Initial concentrations
  "params": {
    "A": 1.0,
    "B": 3.0
  }
}
```

Output:
A numpy array of shape (2,) representing the solution [X, Y] at the final time t1.

Example output:
```
[0.6896964117621737, 4.711673653901621]
```
