PolynomialReal Task:

Given a polynomial of degree n with all real roots, the task is to approximate the roots of the polynomial.
The goal is to compute the approximated roots so that each is within 0.001 of the true valueâ€”i.e., correct to at least three decimal places (any extra precision beyond three decimal places is not considered).
A given solution's distance is said to be the average absolute difference between the approximated roots and the true roots.

Input: A list of polynomial coefficients in descending order.

Example input:
[1.0, -3.54, 3.25, -1.17, 0.23],

(The polynomial is x^4 - 3.54x^3 + 3.25x^2 - 1.17x + 0.23)

Output: A list of approximated roots in descending order.

Example output:
[1.544, 1.022, -0.478, -1.273]

Category: numerical_methods

OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:
Consider these algorithmic improvements for substantial performance gains:
- JAX JIT compilation: Try JAX for massive speedups on numerical operations - start with pure functions
- Companion matrix methods: Alternative eigenvalue-based approach to numpy.roots for better performance
- Iterative root-finding: Newton-Raphson, Durand-Kerner, or Aberth methods with better convergence
- Compilation techniques: JIT frameworks often require specific code structures (functions vs methods)
- Polynomial structure exploitation: Leverage properties like Chebyshev polynomials or specific forms
- Deflation techniques: Remove found roots to improve conditioning for remaining roots
- Initial guess optimization: Better starting points for iterative methods using root bounds
- Specialized algorithms: Research advanced root-finding algorithms
- Multiple precision: Use higher precision only when needed for better accuracy
- Vectorized operations: Process multiple polynomials or roots simultaneously
- Memory-efficient methods: Avoid unnecessary array copies and intermediate calculations
- Hybrid approaches: Combine different methods based on polynomial degree or properties
- Real-root isolation: Use Sturm sequences or Descartes' rule for real-only root finding

This is the initial implementation that will be evolved by OpenEvolve.
The solve method will be improved through evolution.
